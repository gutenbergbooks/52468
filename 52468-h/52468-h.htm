<p><i>De profundis ad te clamavi.</i> In this phrase, with his penchant for epitome, the
late James Huneker summarized the masterpiece of Russia’s single living master of the
drama, Maxim Gorky, as he saw it in Berlin under the German title of “Nachtasyl” or “Night
Lodging.” “Na Dnye” is the Russian—literally “On the Bottom.” Partly because “The Lower
Depths” is a more faithful rendering of the original than “Night Lodging” and partly
because it implies so vividly the play’s keynote as the shrewd Huneker detected it beneath
a guise alien to both Russian and English, the title adopted by Laurence Irving for the
British version has been preferred for its introduction to American audiences by the
company which discovered it and first set it on its stage in Moscow, December 31 (our
calendar), 1902.</p>

<p>In “The Lower Depths” more than in any other single play throughout its history, the
Moscow Art Theatre concentrates its dramatic ideals and methods, its esthetic theory and
practice, and through the production of this play it most emphatically justifies its
artistic faith in spiritual or psychological realism as a dramatic medium of expression.
The plays of Tchekhoff, of course, serve the same ends, but no single one of them does so
quite as richly as does Gorky’s masterpiece. At the hands of Stanislavsky and his
associates, “The Lower Depths” draws much of its convincing power from its unusual use of
and dependence on the channels of expression which are peculiar to the art of the theatre.
It is almost wholly independent of drama as literature. Less than any play I know, is it
possible to imagine its potential effect in the theatre from a reading of its printed
lines. <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>In my book,
“The Russian Theatre,” I have thus analyzed this factor:</p>

<p>“‘The Lower Depths’ is not so much a matter of utterable line and recountable gesture
as it is of the intangible flow of human souls in endlessly shifting contact with one
another. Awkward but eloquent pauses and emphases, the scarcely perceptible stress or
dulling of word or gesture, the nuances and the shadings of which life is mostly made and
by which it reveals its meaning—these, and the instinctive understanding of the vision of
the playwright by those who seek to interpret him, are the incalculable and unrecordable
channels through which ‘The Lower Depths’ becomes articulate at the Moscow Art
Theatre.”</p>

<p>Just as this theatre discovered or, rather, rescued Tchekhoff as a dramatist, so it
first stood sponsor for the author of “Foma Gordeyeff” as a playwright. During the first
half of the season of 1902-1903, two of his plays were produced—“Smug Citizens” and “The
Lower Depths.” The latter was recognized at once as a work of supreme merit and moment.
Tchekhoff himself had written to its youthful author five months before its première: “I
have read your play. It is new and unmistakably fine. The second act is very good, it is
the best, the strongest, and when I was reading it, especially the end, I almost danced
with joy.” At the première, the rival dramatist’s verdict was publicly ratified, for Gorky
was called before the curtain twenty times, and the press was unanimously enthusiastic.
The play has held its place in the repertory of the Moscow Art Theatre ever since, and
eight of its most important rôles are still played by those who created them, just two
decades ago.</p>

<p>Miss Covan’s translation of this play, I believe, deserves particular attention. There
have been numerous translations, differing only in the nature of their ineptitude. Here
for the first time, the vigor, the virility, <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-v">[Pg v]</a></span>the humanity and the humor of the original survive the
transfer from the Russian tongue to our own, without mysterious and vaguely symbolic
“meanings” gratuitously appended. As nearly as it is possible with printed words to convey
the impression which Gorky desires and obtains through the intangible media of the living
stage, the following version succeeds. I realized for the first time, as I read it, that
the overwhelming impression of the play at the hands of the Moscow Art Theatre is due as
much to the genius of the playwright as to that of his interpreters.</p>

<div class="setting">
<p><i>A cellar resembling a cave. The ceiling, which merges into stone walls, is low and
grimy, and the plaster and paint are peeling off. There is a window, high up on the right
wall, from which comes the light. The right corner, which constitutes Pepel’s room, is
partitioned off by thin boards. Close to the corner of this room is Bubnoff’s wooden bunk.
In the left corner stands a large Russian stove. In the stone wall, left, is a door
leading to the kitchen where live Kvashnya, the Baron, and Nastya. Against the wall,
between the stove and the door, is a large bed covered with dirty chintz. Bunks line the
walls. In the foreground, by the left wall, is a block of wood with a vise and a small
anvil fastened to it, and another smaller block of wood somewhat further towards the back.
Kleshtch is seated on the smaller block, trying keys into old locks. At his feet are two
large bundles of various keys, wired together, also a battered tin samovar, a hammer, and
pincers. In the centre are a large table, two benches, and a stool, all of which are of
dirty, unpainted wood. Behind the table Kvashnya is busying herself with the samovar. The
Baron sits chewing a piece of black bread, and Nastya occupies the stool, leans her elbows
on the table, and reads a tattered book. In the bed, behind curtains, Anna lies coughing.
Bubnoff is seated on his bunk, attempting to shape a pair of old trousers with the help of
an ancient hat shape which he holds between his knees. Scattered about him are pieces of
buckram, oilcloth, and rags. Satine, just awakened, lies in his bunk, grunting. On top of

<p>K<small>LESHTCH</small>. Them? Call them people? Muck and dregs—that’s what they are!
I’m a workman—I’m ashamed even to look at them. I’ve slaved since I was a child.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. D’you think I shan’t be able to tear myself <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-14">[Pg 14]</a></span>away from here? I’ll crawl out of here,
even if I have to leave my skin behind—but crawl out I will! Just wait .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. my
wife’ll die .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’ve lived here six months, and it seems like six years.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Nobody here’s any worse off than you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. say what you
like .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>K<small>LESHTCH</small>. No worse is right. They’ve neither honor nor conscience.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small> [<i>indifferently</i>] What good does it do—honor or conscience?
Can you get them on their feet instead of on their uppers—through honor and conscience?
Honor and conscience are needed only by those who have power and energy
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small> [<i>coming back</i>] Oh—I’m frozen .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Bubnoff! Got a conscience?</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. What? A conscience?</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Exactly!</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. What do I need a conscience for? I’m not rich.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Just what I said: honor and conscience are for the rich—right!
And Kleshtch is upbraiding us because we haven’t any!</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. Why—did he want to borrow some of it?</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. No—he has plenty of his own .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. Oh—are you selling it? You won’t sell much around here. But if
you had some old boxes, I’d buy them—on credit .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small> [<i>didactically</i>] You’re a jackass, Andrushka! On the subject
of conscience you ought to hear Satine—or the Baron .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>K<small>LESHTCH</small>. I’ve nothing to talk to them about!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. They have more brains than you—even if they’re drunkards
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. He who can be drunk and wise at the same time is doubly blessed
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Satine says every man expects his neighbor to have a conscience,
but—you see—it isn’t to any one’s advantage to have one—that’s a fact.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small> [<i>twisting his mustache</i>] Aha—Natasha!</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small> [<i>to Luka</i>] I was honest—up to spring before last.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. What an amusing old codger you brought in, Natasha!</p>

<p>N<small>ATASHA</small>. A hanged sight more interesting than you! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Andrei, your wife’s in the kitchen with us—come and fetch her after a while

<p>K<small>LESHTCH</small>. I know .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>N<small>ATASHA</small>. Knowing won’t do any good—it’s terrible—dying—don’t you

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. She’s all right.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. What makes her so curt with me? Anyway—she’ll come to no good
here .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. Through you—sure!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Why through me? I feel sorry for her .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. As the wolf for the lamb!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. You lie! I feel very sorry for her .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. very
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. very sorry! She has a tough life here—I can see that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>K<small>LESHTCH</small>. Just wait till Vassilisa catches you talking to her!</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. Vassilisa? She won’t give up so easily what belongs to
her—she’s a cruel woman!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small> [<i>stretching himself on the bunk</i>] You two prophets can go to

<p>L<small>UKA</small> [<i>singing in the kitchen</i>] “In the dark of the night the way

<p>K<small>LESHTCH</small>. Another one who yelps!</p>

seems all right. But suddenly a cold chill goes through you—and then everything gets
dreary .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. Dreary? Hm-hm—</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Yes—yes—</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small> [<i>sings</i>] “The way is black .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Old fellow! Hey there!</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small> [<i>looking from kitchen door</i>] You call me?</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Yes. Don’t sing!</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small> [<i>coming in</i>] You don’t like it?</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. When people sing well I like it—</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. In other words—I don’t sing well?</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Evidently!</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Well, well—and I thought I sang well. That’s always the way: a man
imagines there’s one thing he can do well, and suddenly he finds out that other people
don’t think so .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small> [<i>laughs</i>] That’s right .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. First you say you feel dreary—and then you laugh!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. None of your business, raven!</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Who do they say feels dreary?</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. I do.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>The Baron enters.</i>]</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Well, well—out there in the kitchen there’s a girl reading and
crying! That’s so! Her eyes are wet with tears .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I say to her: “What’s the
matter, darling?” And she says: “It’s so sad!” “What’s so sad?” say I. “The book!” says
she.—And that’s how people spend their time. Just because they’re bored
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. She’s a fool!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Have you had tea, Baron?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. Yes. Go on!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Well—want me to open a bottle?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. Of course. Go on!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Drop on all fours, and bark like a dog!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. Fool! What’s the matter with you? Are you
drunk?</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Go on—bark a little! It’ll amuse me. You’re an aristocrat. You
didn’t even consider us human formerly, did you?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. Go on!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Well—and now I am making you bark like a dog—and you will bark,
won’t you?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. All right. I will. You jackass! What pleasure
can you derive from it since I myself know that I have sunk almost lower than you. You
should have made me drop on all fours in the days when I was still above you.</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. That’s right .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. I say so, too!</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. What’s over, is over. Remain only trivialities. We know no
class distinctions here. We’ve shed all pride and self-respect. Blood and bone—man—just
plain man—that’s what we are!</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. In other words, we’re all equal .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and you, friend,
were you really a Baron?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. Who are you? A ghost?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small> [<i>laughing</i>] I’ve seen counts and princes in my day—this is
the first time I meet a baron—and one who’s decaying—at that!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small> [<i>laughing</i>] Baron, I blush for you!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. It’s time you knew better, Vassily
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Hey-hey—I look at you, brothers—the life you’re leading
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. Such a life! As soon as the sun rises, our voices rise, too—in
quarrels!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. We’ve all seen better days—yes! I used to wake
up in the morning and drink my coffee in bed—coffee—with cream! Yes—</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. And yet we’re all human beings. Pretend all you want to, put on
all the airs you wish, but man you were born, and man you must die. And as I watch I see
that the wiser people get, the busier they get—and though from bad to worse, they still
strive to improve—stubbornly—</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. Who are you, old fellow? Where do you come
from?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. I?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. Are you a tramp?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. We’re all of us tramps—why—I’ve heard said that the very earth we
walk on is nothing but a tramp in the universe.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small> [<i>severely</i>] Perhaps. But have you a
passport?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small> [<i>after a short pause</i>] And what are you—a police
inspector?</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small> [<i>delighted</i>] You scored, old fellow! Well, Barosha, you got
it this time!</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. Yes—our little aristocrat got his!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small> [<i>embarrassed</i>] What’s the matter? I was
only joking, old man. Why, brother, I haven’t a passport, either.</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. You lie!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. Oh—well—I have some sort of papers—but they
have no value—</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. They’re papers just the same—and no papers are any good—</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Baron—come on to the saloon with me—</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. I’m ready. Good-bye, old man—you old
scamp—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Maybe I am one, brother—</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small> [<i>near doorway</i>] Come on—come on!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Leaves, Baron following him quickly.</i>]</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Was he really once a Baron?</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. Who knows? A gentleman—? Yes. That much he’s even now.
Occasionally it sticks out. He never got rid of the habit.</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Nobility is like small-pox. A man may get over it—but it leaves
marks .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. He’s all right all the same—occasionally he kicks—as he did
about your passport .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Alyoshka comes in, slightly drunk, with a concertina in his hand,

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. On a spree again?</p>

<p>A<small>LYOSHKA</small>. Right you are! A moment ago Medyakin, the precinct captain,
threw me out of the police station and said: “Look here—I don’t want as much as a smell of
you to stay in the streets—d’you hear?” I’m a man of principles, and the boss croaks at
me—and what’s a boss anyway—pah!—it’s all bosh—the boss is a drunkard. I don’t make any
demands on life. I want nothing—that’s all. Offer me one ruble, offer me twenty—it doesn’t
affect me. [<i>Nastya comes from the kitchen</i>] Offer me a million—I won’t take it! And
to think that I, a respectable man, should be ordered about by a pal of mine—and he a
drunkard! I won’t have it—I won’t!</p>

There! Medyakin said: “If you show yourself on the streets I smash your face!” And yet I
shall go out—I’ll go—and stretch out in the middle of the street—let them choke me—I don’t
want a thing!</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small> [<i>calmly</i>] You’re not wanted anywhere—and, anyway, all
people on earth are superfluous—</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Nastya shakes her head. Rises and slowly, quietly, leaves the

<p>M<small>IEDVIEDIEFF</small>. I don’t think I know you—</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. How about the others—d’you know them all?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>M<small>IEDVIEDIEFF</small>. I must know everybody in my precinct. But I don’t know
you.</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. That’s because, uncle, the whole world can’t stow itself away in
your precinct—some of it was bound to remain outside .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [<i>Goes into
kitchen</i>]</p>

<p>M<small>IEDVIEDIEFF</small> [<i>crosses to Bubnoff</i>] It’s true—my precinct is rather
small—yet it’s worse than any of the very largest. Just now, before getting off duty, I
had to bring Alyoshka, the shoemaker, to the station house. Just imagine—there he was,
stretched right in the middle of the street, playing his concertina and yelping: “I want
nothing, nothing!” Horses going past all the time—and with all the traffic going on, he
could easily have been run over—and so on! He’s a wild youngster—so I just collared him—he
likes to make mischief—</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. Coming to play checkers to-night?</p>

<p>M<small>IEDVIEDIEFF</small>. Yes—I’ll come—how’s Vaska?</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. Same as ever—</p>

<p>M<small>IEDVIEDIEFF</small>. Meaning—he’s getting along—?</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. Why shouldn’t he? He’s able to get along all right.</p>

<p>M<small>IEDVIEDIEFF</small> [<i>doubtfully</i>] Why shouldn’t he? [<i>Luka goes into
hallway, carrying a pail</i>] M-yes—there’s a lot of talk about Vaska. Haven’t you
heard?</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. I hear all sorts of gossip .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>M<small>IEDVIEDIEFF</small>. There seems to have been some sort of talk concerning
Vassilisa. Haven’t you heard about it?</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. What?</p>

<p>M<small>IEDVIEDIEFF</small>. Oh—why—generally speaking. Perhaps you know—and lie.
Everybody knows—[<i>Severely</i>] You mustn’t lie, brother!</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. Why should I lie?</p>

<p>M<small>IEDVIEDIEFF</small>. That’s right. Dogs! They say that Vaska and Vassilisa
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but what’s that to me? I’m <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-26">[Pg 26]</a></span>not her father. I’m her uncle. Why should they ridicule me?
[<i>Kvashnya comes in</i>] What are people coming to? They laugh at everything. Aha—you
here?</p>

<p>K<small>VASHNYA</small>. Well—my love-sick garrison—? Bubnoff! He came up to me again
on the marketplace and started pestering me about marrying him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. Go to it! Why not? He has money and he’s still a husky
fellow.</p>

<p>M<small>IEDVIEDIEFF</small>. Me—? I should say so!</p>

<p>K<small>VASHNYA</small>. You ruffian! Don’t you dare touch my sore spot! I’ve gone
through it once already, darling. Marriage to a woman is just like jumping through a hole
in the ice in winter. You do it once, and you remember it the rest of your life
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>M<small>IEDVIEDIEFF</small>. Wait! There are different breeds of husbands
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>K<small>VASHNYA</small>. But there’s only one of me! When my beloved husband kicked the
bucket, I spent the whole day all by my lonely—just bursting with joy. I sat and simply
couldn’t believe it was true. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>M<small>IEDVIEDIEFF</small>. If your husband beat you without cause, you should have
complained to the police.</p>

<p>K<small>VASHNYA</small>. I complained to God for eight years—and he didn’t help.</p>

<p>M<small>IEDVIEDIEFF</small>. Nowadays the law forbids to beat your wife .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
all is very strict these days—there’s law and order everywhere. You can’t beat up people
without due cause. If you beat them to maintain discipline—all right .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small> [<i>comes in with Anna</i>] Well—we finally managed to get here
after all. Oh, you! Why do you, weak as you are, walk about alone? Where’s your bunk?</p>

<p>A<small>NNA</small> [<i>pointing</i>] Thank you, grand-dad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>K<small>VASHNYA</small>. There—she’s married—look at her!</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. The little woman is in very bad shape .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she was
creeping along the hallway, clinging to the wall and moaning—why do you leave her by
herself?</p>

<p>K<small>VASHNYA</small>. Oh, pure carelessness on our part, little father—forgive us!
Her maid, it appears, went out for a walk .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Go on—poke fun at me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but, all the same, how can
you neglect a human being like that? No matter who or what, every human life has its worth
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>M<small>IEDVIEDIEFF</small>. There should be supervision! Suppose she died suddenly—?
That would cause a lot of bother .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we must look after her!</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. True, sergeant!</p>

<p>M<small>IEDVIEDIEFF</small>. Well—yes—though I’m not a sergeant—ah—yet!</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. No! But you carry yourself most martially!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Noise of shuffling feet is heard in the hallway. Muffled

<p>M<small>IEDVIEDIEFF</small>. What now—a row?</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. Sounds like it?</p>

<p>K<small>VASHNYA</small>. I’ll go and see .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>M<small>IEDVIEDIEFF</small>. I’ll go, too. It is my duty! Why separate people when they
fight? They’ll stop sooner or later of their own accord. One gets tired of fighting. Why
not let them fight all they want to—freely? They wouldn’t fight half as often—if they’d
remember former beatings .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small> [<i>climbing down from his bunk</i>] Why don’t you speak to your

<p>A<small>NNA</small>. Anna .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I look at you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you’re like my

They treat you free of charge, brother. There’s a hospital for drunkards—where they’re

not exactly a sergeant—yet—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. I jump two!</p>

<p>M<small>IEDVIEDIEFF</small>. Damn—play!</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. And the Lord will look at you gently and tenderly and He’ll say:
“I know this Anna!” Then He’ll say: “Take Anna into Paradise. Let her have peace. I know.
Her life on earth was hard. She is very weary. Let Anna rest in peace!”</p>

<p>A<small>NNA</small> [<i>choking</i>] Grandfather—if it were only so—if there were only
rest and peace .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. There won’t be anything else! Trust me! Die in joy and not in
grief. Death is to us like a mother to small children .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>A<small>NNA</small>. But—perhaps—perhaps I get well .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small> [<i>laughing</i>] Why—? Just to suffer more?</p>

<p>A<small>NNA</small>. But—just to live a little longer .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. just a little
longer! Since there’ll be no suffering hereafter, I could bear it a little longer down
here .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. There’ll be nothing in the hereafter .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but only
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small> [<i>rising</i>] Maybe yes—maybe no!</p>

<p>A<small>NNA</small> [<i>frightened</i>] Oh—God!</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Hey—Adonis!</p>

<p>M<small>IEDVIEDIEFF</small>. Who’s that yelping?</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small> [<i>crossing over to him</i>] I! What of it?</p>

<p>M<small>IEDVIEDIEFF</small>. You yelp needlessly—that’s what! People ought to have some
dignity!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Block-head! And that’s an uncle for you—ho-ho!</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small> [<i>to Pepel, in an undertone</i>] Look here—don’t shout—this
woman’s dying—her lips are already grey—don’t disturb her!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. I’ve respect for you, grand-dad. You’re all right, you are! You
lie well, and you spin pleasant <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-37">[Pg
37]</a></span>yarns. Go on lying, brother—there’s little fun in this world
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. Is the woman really dying?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. You think I’m joking?</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. That means she’ll stop coughing. Her cough was very disturbing.
I jump two!</p>

<p>M<small>IEDVIEDIEFF</small>. I’d like to murder you!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Abramka!</p>

<p>M<small>IEDVIEDIEFF</small>. I’m not Abramka to you!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Abrashka! Is Natasha ill?</p>

<p>M<small>IEDVIEDIEFF</small>. None of your business!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Come—tell me! Did Vassilisa beat her up very badly?</p>

<p>M<small>IEDVIEDIEFF</small>. That’s none of your business, either! It’s a family
affair! Who are you anyway?</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Whoever I am, you’ll never see Natashka again if I choose!</p>

<p>M<small>IEDVIEDIEFF</small> [<i>throwing up the game</i>] What’s that? Who are you
alluding to? My niece by any chance? You thief!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. A thief whom you were never able to catch!</p>

<p>M<small>IEDVIEDIEFF</small>. Wait—I’ll catch you yet—you’ll see—sooner than you
think!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. If you catch me, God help your whole nest! Do you think I’ll keep
quiet before the examining magistrate? Every wolf howls! They’ll ask me: “Who made you
steal and showed you where?” “Mishka Kostilyoff and his wife!” “Who was your fence?”
“Mishka Kostilyoff and his wife!”</p>

<p>M<small>IEDVIEDIEFF</small>. You lie! No one will believe you!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. They’ll believe me all right—because it’s the truth! And I’ll
drag you into it, too. Ha! I’ll ruin the lot of you—devils—just watch!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>M<small>IEDVIEDIEFF</small> [<i>confused</i>] You lie! You lie! And what harm did I do
to you, you mad dog?</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. And what good did you ever do me?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. That’s right!</p>

<p>M<small>IEDVIEDIEFF</small> [<i>to Luka</i>] Well—what are you croaking about? Is it
any of your business? This is a family matter!</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small> [<i>to Luka</i>] Leave them alone! What do we care if they twist
each other’s tails?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small> [<i>peacefully</i>] I meant no harm. All I said was that if a man
isn’t good to you, then he’s acting wrong .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>M<small>IEDVIEDIEFF</small> [<i>uncomprehending</i>] Now then—we all of us here know
each other—but you—who are you? [<i>Frowns and exit</i>]</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. The cavalier is peeved! Oh-ho, brothers, I see your affairs are a
bit tangled up!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. He’ll run to complain about us to Vassilisa .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. You’re a fool, Vassily. You’re very bold these days, aren’t
you? Watch out! It’s all right to be bold when you go gathering mushrooms, but what good
is it here? They’ll break your neck before you know it!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Well—not as fast as all that! You don’t catch us Yaroslavl boys
napping! If it’s going to be war, we’ll fight .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Look here, boy, you really ought to go away from here—</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Where? Please tell me!</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Go to Siberia!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. If I go to Siberia, it’ll be at the Tsar’s expense!</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Listen! You go just the same! You can <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-39">[Pg 39]</a></span>make your own way there. They need your
kind out there .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. My way is clear. My father spent all his life in prison, and I
inherited the trait. Even when I was a small child, they called me thief—thief’s son.</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. But Siberia is a fine country—a land of gold. Any one who has
health and strength and brains can live there like a cucumber in a hot-house.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Old man, why do you always tell lies?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. What?</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Are you deaf? I ask—why do you always lie?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. What do I lie about?</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. About everything. According to you, life’s wonderful
everywhere—but you lie .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. why?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Try to believe me. Go and see for yourself. And some day you’ll
thank me for it. What are you hanging round here for? And, besides, why is truth so
important to you? Just think! Truth may spell death to you!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. It’s all one to me! If that—let it be that!</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Oh—what a madman! Why should you kill yourself?</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. What are you two jawing about, anyway? I don’t understand. What
kind of truth do you want, Vaska? And what for? You know the truth about yourself—and so
does everybody else .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Just a moment! Don’t crow! Let him tell me! Listen, old man! Is
there a God?</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Luka smiles silently.</i>]</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. People just drift along—like shavings on a stream. When a house
is built—the shavings are thrown away!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Well? Is there a God? Tell me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small> [<i>in a low voice</i>] If you have faith, there is; if you
haven’t, there isn’t .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. whatever you believe in, exists .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Pepel looks at Luka in staring surprise.</i>]</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. I’m going to have tea—come on over to the restaurant!</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small> [<i>to Pepel</i>] What are you staring at?</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Oh—just because! Wait now—you mean to say .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. Well—I’m off.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Goes to door and runs into Vassilisa.</i>]</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. So—you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>V<small>ASSILISA</small> [<i>to Bubnoff</i>] Is Nastasya home?</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. No. [<i>Exit</i>]</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Oh—you’ve come—?</p>

<p>V<small>ASSILISA</small> [<i>crossing to Anna</i>] Is she alive yet?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Don’t disturb her!</p>

<p>V<small>ASSILISA</small>. What are you loafing around here for?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. I’ll go—if you want me to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>V<small>ASSILISA</small> [<i>turning towards Pepel’s room</i>] Vassily! I’ve some
business with you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Luka goes to hallway door, opens it, and shuts it loudly, then
warily climbs into a bunk, and from there to the top of the stove.</i>]</p>

<p>V<small>ASSILISA</small> [<i>calling from Pepel’s room</i>] Vaska—come here!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. I won’t come—I don’t want to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>V<small>ASSILISA</small>. Why? What are you angry about?</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. I’m sick of the whole thing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>V<small>ASSILISA</small>. Sick of me, too?</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Yes! Of you, too!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Vassilisa draws her shawl about her, pressing her hands over her

Pepel.</i>]</p>

<p class="noindent">Well—out with it!</p>

<p>V<small>ASSILISA</small>. What do you want me to say? I can’t force you to be loving,
and I’m not the sort to beg for kindness. Thank you for telling me the truth.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. What truth?</p>

<p>V<small>ASSILISA</small>. That you’re sick of me—or isn’t it the truth? [<i>Pepel looks
at her silently. She turns to him</i>] What are you staring at? Don’t you recognize
me?</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small> [<i>sighing</i>] You’re beautiful, Vassilisa! [<i>She puts her arm
about his neck, but he shakes it off</i>] But I never gave my heart to you.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’ve lived with you and all that—But I never really liked you
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>V<small>ASSILISA</small> [<i>quietly</i>] That so? Well—?</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. What is there to talk, about? Nothing. Go away from me!</p>

<p>V<small>ASSILISA</small>. Taken a fancy to some one else?</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. None of your business! Suppose I have—I wouldn’t ask you to be my
match-maker!</p>

<p>V<small>ASSILISA</small> [<i>significantly</i>] That’s too bad .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. perhaps
I might arrange a match .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small> [<i>suspiciously</i>] Who with?</p>

<p>V<small>ASSILISA</small>. You know—why do you pretend? Vassily—let me be frank.
[<i>With lower voice</i>] I won’t deny it—you’ve offended me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it was like a
bolt from the blue .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you said you loved me—and then all of a sudden
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. It wasn’t sudden at all. It’s been a long time since I
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. woman, you’ve no soul! A woman must have a soul .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. we men are
beasts—we must be taught—and you, what have you taught me—?</p>

<p>V<small>ASSILISA</small>. Never mind the past! I know—no man <span class="pagenum"><a
class="newpage" id="page-42">[Pg 42]</a></span>owns his own heart—you don’t love me any
longer .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well and good, it can’t be helped!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. So that’s over. We part peaceably, without a row—as it should
be!</p>

<p>V<small>ASSILISA</small>. Just a moment! All the same, when I lived with you, I hoped
you’d help me out of this swamp—I thought you’d free me from my husband and my uncle—from
all this life—and perhaps, Vassya, it wasn’t you whom I loved—but my hope—do you
understand? I waited for you to drag me out of this mire .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. You aren’t a nail—and I’m not a pair of pincers! I thought you
had brains—you are so clever—so crafty .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>V<small>ASSILISA</small> [<i>leaning closely towards him</i>] Vassa—let’s help each
other!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. How?</p>

<p>V<small>ASSILISA</small> [<i>low and forcibly</i>] My sister—I know you’ve fallen for
her. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. And that’s why you beat her up, like the beast you are! Look out,
Vassilisa! Don’t you touch her!</p>

<p>V<small>ASSILISA</small>. Wait. Don’t get excited. We can do everything quietly and
pleasantly. You want to marry her. I’ll give you money .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. three hundred
rubles—even more than that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small> [<i>moving away from her</i>] Stop! What do you mean?</p>

<p>V<small>ASSILISA</small>. Rid me of my husband! Take that noose from around my neck
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small> [<i>whistling softly</i>] So that’s the way the land lies! You
certainly planned it cleverly .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in other words, the grave for the husband,
the gallows for the lover, and as for yourself .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>V<small>ASSILISA</small>. Vassya! Why the gallows? It doesn’t have to be yourself—but
one of your pals! And supposing it were yourself—who’d know? Natalia—just think—and you’ll
have money—you go away somewhere .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you free me forever—and it’ll be very
good for my sister to be away from me—the sight of her enrages me. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I get
furious with her on account of you, and I can’t control myself. I tortured the girl—I beat
her up—beat her up so that I myself cried with pity for her—but I’ll beat her—and I’ll go
on beating her!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Beast! Bragging about your beastliness?</p>

<p>V<small>ASSILISA</small>. I’m not bragging—I speak the truth. Think now, Vassa. You’ve
been to prison twice because of my husband—through his greed. He clings to me like a
bed-bug—he’s been sucking the life out of me for the last four years—and what sort of a
husband is he to me? He’s forever abusing Natasha—calls her a beggar—he’s just poison,
plain poison, to every one .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. You spin your yarn cleverly .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>V<small>ASSILISA</small>. Everything I say is true. Only a fool could be as blind as
you. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Kostilyoff enters stealthily and comes forward noisily.</i>]</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small> [<i>to Vassilisa</i>] Oh—go away!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Pepel leaps up and stares at Kostilyoff savagely.</i>]</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small> [<i>to Kostilyoff</i>] Go away—clear out of here—</p>

<p>K<small>OSTILYOFF</small> [<i>yelling</i>] What? I? The Boss? I get out? You thief!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small> [<i>sullenly</i>] Go away, Mishka!</p>

<p>K<small>OSTILYOFF</small>. Don’t you dare—I—I’ll show you.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Pepel seizes him by the collar and shakes him. From the stove

<p>P<small>EPEL</small> [<i>roughly</i>] What did you climb on that stove for?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Where was I to go?</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Why—didn’t you go out into the hall?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. The hall’s too cold for an old fellow like myself, brother.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. You overheard?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Yes—I did. How could I help it? Am I deaf? Well, my boy, happiness
is coming your way. Real, good fortune I call it!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small> [<i>suspiciously</i>] What good fortune—?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. In so far as I was lying on the stove .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Why did you make all that noise?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Because I was getting warm .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it was your good luck
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I thought if only the boy wouldn’t make a mistake and choke the old man
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Yes—I might have done it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. how terrible
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Small wonder! It isn’t difficult to make a mistake of that
sort.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small> [<i>smiling</i>] What’s the matter? Did you make the same sort of
mistake once upon a time?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Boy, listen to me. Send that woman out of your life! Don’t let her
near you! Her husband—she’ll get rid of him herself—and in a shrewder way than you
could—yes! Don’t you listen to that devil! Look at me! I am bald-headed—know why? Because
of all these women. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Perhaps I knew more women than I had hair on the top
of my head—but this Vassilisa—she’s worse than the plague. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. I don’t understand .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don’t know whether to thank
you—or—well .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Don’t say a word! You won’t improve on what I said. Listen: take
the one you like by the arm, and march out of here—get out of here—clean out
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small> [<i>sadly</i>] I can’t understand people. Who is kind and who
isn’t? It’s all a mystery to me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. What’s there to understand? There’s all breeds of men
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they all live as their hearts tell them .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. good to-day, bad
to-morrow! But if you really care for that girl .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. take her away from here
and that’s all there is to it. Otherwise go away alone .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you’re young—you’re
in no hurry for a wife .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small> [<i>taking him by the shoulder</i>] Tell me! Why do you say all
this?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Wait. Let me go. I want a look at Anna <span class="pagenum"><a

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small> [<i>lying down</i>] Well—that’s your own affair

we?</p>

a high brick wall which shuts out the sight of the sky. Near it are elder bushes. Right,
the dark, wooden wall of some sort of house, barn or stable. Left, the grey, tumbledown
wall of Kostilyoff’s night asylum. It is built at an angle so that the further corner
reaches almost to the centre of the yard. Between it and the wall runs a narrow passage.
In the grey, plastered wall are two windows, one on a level with the ground, the other
about six feet higher up and closer to the brick wall. Near the latter wall is a big
sledge turned upside down and a beam about twelve feet long. Right of the wall is a heap
of old planks. Evening. The sun is setting, throwing a crimson light on the brick wall.
Early spring, the snow having only recently melted. The elder bushes are not yet in
bud.</p>

<p>N<small>ASTYA</small> [<i>with closed eyes, nodding her head in rhythm to the tale she

waiting for him quite a while. I trembled with fear and grief—he trembled, too

.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>N<small>ATASHA</small> [<i>chewing sun-flower seeds</i>] Oh—are these students really
such desperate fellows .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>N<small>ASTYA</small>. And he says to me in a dreadful voice: “My precious darling
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. Ho-ho! Precious—?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. Shut up! If you don’t like it, you can lump
it! But don’t interrupt her. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Go on .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>N<small>ASTYA</small>. “My one and only love,” he says, “my parents,” he says, “refuse
to give their consent to our wedding—and threaten to disown me because of my love for you.
Therefore,” he says, “I must take my life.” And his pistol was huge—and loaded with ten
bullets .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “Farewell,” he says, “beloved comrade! I have made up my mind for
good and all .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I can’t live without you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” and I replied: “My
unforgettable friend—my Raoul. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small> [<i>surprised</i>] What? What? Krawl—did you call him—?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. Nastka! But last time his name was Gaston.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>N<small>ASTYA</small> [<i>jumping up</i>] Shut up, you bastards! Ah—you lousy mongrels!
You think for a moment that you can understand love—true love? My love was real
honest-to-God love! [<i>To the Baron</i>] You good-for-nothing! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. educated,
you call yourself—drinking coffee in bed, did you?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Now, now! Wait, people! Don’t interfere! Show a little respect to
your neighbors .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it isn’t the word that matters, but what’s in back of the
word. That’s what matters! Go on, girl! It’s all right!</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. Go on, crow! See if you can make your feathers white!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. Well—continue!</p>

<p>N<small>ATASHA</small>. Pay no attention to them .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what are they? They’re
just jealous .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they’ve nothing to tell about themselves .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>N<small>ASTYA</small> [<i>sits down again</i>] I’m going to say no more! If they don’t
believe me they’ll laugh. [<i>Stops suddenly, is silent for a few seconds, then, shutting
her eyes,</i> <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-53">[Pg

I, too, I can’t live without you—because I love you madly, so madly—and I shall keep on
loving you as long as my heart beats in my bosom. But—” I say—“don’t take your young life!
Think how necessary it is to your dear parents whose only happiness you are. Leave me!
Better that I should perish from longing for you, my life! I alone! I—ah—as such, such!
Better that I should die—it doesn’t matter .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am of no use to the world—and
I have nothing, nothing at all—” [<i>Covers her face with her hand and weeps

<p>N<small>ATASHA</small> [<i>in a low voice</i>] Don’t cry—don’t!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Luka, smiling, strokes Nastya’s head.</i>]</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small> [<i>laughs</i>] Ah—you limb of Satan!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small> [<i>also laughs</i>] Hey, old man? Do you think

Soul—bah!—you haven’t got one!</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small> [<i>takes Nastya’s hand</i>] Come, dear! It’s nothing! Don’t be

affair, then you did—yes! And as for him—don’t be angry with a fellow-lodger
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. maybe he’s really jealous, and that’s why he’s laughing. Maybe he never
had any real love—maybe not—come on—let’s go!</p>

<p>N<small>ASTYA</small> [<i>pressing her hand against her breast</i>] Grandfather! So
help me God—it happened! It happened! He was a student, a Frenchman—Gastotcha was his
name—he had a little black beard—and patent leathers—may God strike me dead if I’m lying!
And he loved me so—my God, how he loved me!</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Yes, yes, it’s all right. I believe you! Patent <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-54">[Pg 54]</a></span>leathers, you said?
Well, well, well—and you loved him, did you? [<i>Disappears with her around the
corner</i>]</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. God—isn’t she a fool, though? She’s
good-hearted—but such a fool—it’s past belief!</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. And why are people so fond of lying—just as if they were up
before the judge—really!</p>

<p>N<small>ATASHA</small>. I guess lying is more fun than speaking the truth—I, too
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. What—you, too? Go on!</p>

<p>N<small>ATASHA</small>. Oh—I imagine things—invent them—and I wait—</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. For what?</p>

<p>N<small>ATASHA</small> [<i>smiling confusedly</i>] Oh—I think that
perhaps—well—to-morrow somebody will really appear—some one—oh—out of the ordinary—or
something’ll happen—also out of the ordinary. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’ve been waiting for
it—oh—always. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But, really, what is there to wait for? [<i>Pause</i>]</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small> [<i>with a slight smile</i>] Nothing—I expect
nothing! What is past, is past! Through! Over with! And then what?</p>

<p>N<small>ATASHA</small>. And then—well—to-morrow I imagine suddenly that I’ll die—and I
get frightened .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in summer it’s all right to dream of death—then there are
thunder storms—one might get struck by lightning .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. You’ve a hard life .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. your
sister’s a wicked-tempered devil!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. Well—I’d better go and make my peace with
Nastinka—if I don’t, she won’t treat me to vodka .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. Hm—people love to lie .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. with Nastka—I can see the
reason why. She’s used to painting that mutt of hers—and now she wants to paint her soul
as well .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. put rouge on her soul, eh? But the others—why do they? Take Luka
for instance—he lies a lot .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and what does he get out of it? He’s an old
fellow, too—why does he do it?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small> [<i>smiling and walking away</i>] All people
have drab-colored souls—and they like to brighten them up a bit .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small> [<i>appearing from round the corner</i>] You, sir, why do you tease
the girl? Leave her alone—let her cry if it amuses her .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she weeps for her
own pleasure—what harm is it to you?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. Nonsense, old man! She’s a nuisance. Raoul
to-day, Gaston to-morrow—always the same old yarn, though! Still—I’ll go and make up with
her. [<i>Leaves</i>]</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. That’s right—go—and be nice to her. Being nice to people never
does them any harm .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>N<small>ATASHA</small>. You’re so good, little father—why are you so good?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Good, did you say? Well—call it that! [<i>Behind the brick wall is
heard soft singing and the sounds of a concertina</i>] Some one has to be kind, girl—some
one must pity people! Christ pitied everybody—and he said to us: “Go and do likewise!” I
tell you—if you pity a man when he most needs it, good comes of it. Why—I used to be a
watchman on the estate of an engineer near Tomsk—all right—the house was right in the
middle of a forest—lonely place—winter came—and I remained all by myself. Well—one night I
heard a noise—</p>

<p>N<small>ATASHA</small>. Thieves?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Exactly! Thieves creeping in! I took my gun—I went out. I looked
and saw two of them opening a window—and so busy that they didn’t even see me. I yell:
“Hey there—get out of here!” And they turn on me with their axes—I warn them to stand
back, or I’d shoot—and as I speak, I keep on covering them with my gun, first the one,
then the other—they go down on their knees, as if to implore me for mercy. And by that
time I was furious—because of those axes, you see—and so I say to them: “I was chasing
you, you scoundrels—and you didn’t go. Now you go and break off some stout branches!”—and
they did so—and I say: “Now—one of you lie down and let the other one flog him!” So they
obey me and flog each other—and then they begin to implore me again. “Grandfather,” they
say, “for God’s sake give us some bread! We’re hungry!” There’s thieves for you, my dear!
[<i>Laughs</i>] And with an ax, too! Yes—honest peasants, both of them! And I say to them,
“You should have asked for bread straight away!” And they say: “We got tired of asking—you
beg and beg—and nobody gives you a crumb—it hurts!” So they stayed with me all that
winter—one of them, Stepan, would take my gun and go shooting in the forest—and the other,
Yakoff, was ill most of the time—he coughed a lot .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and so the three of us
together looked after the house .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. then spring came .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
“Good-bye, grandfather,” they said—and they went away—back home to Russia
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>N<small>ATASHA</small>. Were they escaped convicts?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. That’s just what they were—escaped convicts—from a Siberian prison
camp .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. honest peasants! If I hadn’t felt sorry for them—they might have
killed me—or maybe worse—and then there would have been trial and prison and afterwards
Siberia—what’s the sense of it? Prison teaches no good—and Siberia doesn’t either—but
another human being can <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-57">[Pg
57]</a></span>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yes, a human being can teach another one kindness—very
simply! [<i>Pause</i>]</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. Hm—yes—I, for instance, don’t know how to lie .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
why—as far as I’m concerned, I believe in coming out with the whole truth and putting it
on thick .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. why fuss about it?</p>

<p>K<small>LESHTCH</small> [<i>again jumps up as if his clothes were on fire, and
screams</i>] What truth? Where is there truth? [<i>Tearing at his ragged clothes</i>]
Here’s truth for you! No work! No strength! That’s the only truth! Shelter—there’s no
shelter! You die—that’s the truth! Hell! What do I want with the truth? Let me breathe!
Why should I be blamed? What do I want with truth? To live—Christ Almighty!—they won’t let
you live—and that’s another truth!</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. He’s mad!</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Dear Lord .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. listen to me, brother—</p>

<p>K<small>LESHTCH</small> [<i>trembling with excitement</i>] They say: there’s truth!
You, old man, try to console every one .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I tell you—I hate every one! And
there’s your truth—God curse it—understand? I tell you—God curse it!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Rushes away round the corner, turning as he goes.</i>]</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. God—didn’t he say a whole lot, though? As if he was playing
drama—he gets those fits often .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he isn’t used to life yet
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small> [<i>comes slowly round the corner</i>] Peace on all this honest
gathering! Well, Luka, you wily old fellow—still telling them stories?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. You should have heard how that fellow carried on!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Kleshtch—wasn’t it? What’s wrong with him? He was running like
one possessed!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. You’d do the same if your own heart were breaking!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small> [<i>sitting down</i>] I don’t like him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he’s got
such a nasty, bad temper—and so proud! [<i>Imitating Kleshtch</i>] “I’m a workman!” And he
thinks everyone’s beneath him. Go on working if you feel like it—nothing to be so damned
haughty about! If work is the standard—a horse can give us points—pulls like hell and says
nothing! Natasha—are your folks at home?</p>

<p>N<small>ATASHA</small>. They went to the cemetery—then to night service
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. So that’s why you’re free for once—quite a novelty!</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small> [<i>to Bubnoff, thoughtfully</i>] There—you say—truth! Truth
doesn’t always heal a wounded soul. For instance, I knew of a man who believed in a land
of righteousness .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. In what?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. In a land of righteousness. He said: “Somewhere on this earth
there must be a righteous land—and wonderful people live there—good people! They respect
each other, help each other, and everything is peaceful and good!” And so that man—who was
always searching for this land of righteousness—he was poor and lived miserably—and when
things got to be so bad with him that it seemed there was nothing else for him to do
except lie down and die—even then he never lost heart—but he’d just smile and say: “Never
mind! I can stand it! A little while longer—and I’ll have done with this life—and I’ll go
in search of the righteous land!”—it was his one happiness—the thought of that land
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Well? Did he go there?</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. Where? Ho-ho!</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. And then to this place—in Siberia, by the way—there came a
convict—a learned man with books <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-59">[Pg
59]</a></span>and maps—yes, a learned man who knew all sorts of things—and the other man
said to him: “Do me a favor—show me where is the land of righteousness and how I can get
there.” At once the learned man opened his books, spread out his maps, and looked and
looked and he said—no—he couldn’t find this land anywhere .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. everything was
correct—all the lands on earth were marked—but not this land of righteousness
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small> [<i>in a low voice</i>] Well? Wasn’t there a trace of it?</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Bubnoff roars with laughter.</i>]</p>

<p>N<small>ATASHA</small>. Wait .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, little father?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. The man wouldn’t believe it. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “It must exist,” he
said, “look carefully. Otherwise,” he says, “your books and maps are of no use if there’s
no land of righteousness.” The learned man was offended. “My plans,” he said, “are
correct. But there exists no land of righteousness anywhere.” Well, then the other man got
angry. He’d lived and lived and suffered and suffered, and had believed all the time in
the existence of this land—and now, according to the plans, it didn’t exist at all. He
felt robbed! And he said to the learned man: “Ah—you scum of the earth! You’re not a
learned man at all—but just a damned cheat!”—and he gave him a good wallop in the eye—then
another one .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [<i>After a moment’s silence</i>] And then he went home and
hanged himself!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>All are silent. Luka, smiling, looks at Pepel and
Natasha.</i>]</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small> [<i>low-voiced</i>] To hell with this story—it isn’t very cheerful
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>N<small>ATASHA</small>. He couldn’t stand the disappointment .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small> [<i>sullen</i>] Ah—it’s nothing but a fairy-tale
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Well—there is the righteous land for you—doesn’t exist, it seems
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>N<small>ATASHA</small>. I’m sorry for that man .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. All a story—ho-ho!—land of righteousness—what an idea! [<i>Exit
through window</i>]</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small> [<i>pointing to window</i>] He’s laughing! [<i>Pause</i>] Well,
children, God be with you! I’ll leave you soon .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Where are you going to?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. To the Ukraine—I heard they discovered a new religion there—I want
to see—yes! People are always seeking—they always want something better—God grant them
patience!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. You think they’ll find it?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. The people? They will find it! He who seeks, will find! He who
desires strongly, will find!</p>

<p>N<small>ATASHA</small>. If only they could find something better—invent something
better .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. They’re trying to! But we must help them girl—we must respect them
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>N<small>ATASHA</small>. How can I help them? I am helpless myself!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small> [<i>determined</i>] Again—listen—I’ll speak to you again,
Natasha—here—before him—he knows everything .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. run away with me?</p>

<p>N<small>ATASHA</small>. Where? From one prison to another?</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. I told you—I’m through with being a thief, so help me God! I’ll
quit! If I say so, I’ll do it! I can read and write—I’ll work—He’s been telling me to go
to Siberia on my own hook—let’s go there together, what do you say? Do you think I’m not
disgusted with my life? Oh—Natasha—I know .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I see .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I console
myself with the thought that there are lots of people who are honored and respected—and
who are bigger thieves than I! But what good is that to me? It isn’t that I repent
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’ve no conscience .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but I do feel one thing: One must live
differently. One must live a better life .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. one must be able to respect one’s
own self .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. That’s right, friend! May God help you! It’s true! A man must
respect himself!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. I’ve been a thief from childhood on. Everybody always called me
“Vaska—the thief—the son of a thief!” Oh—very well then—I am a thief— .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. just
imagine—now, perhaps, I’m a thief out of spite—perhaps I’m a thief because no one ever
called me anything different. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, Natasha—?</p>

<p>N<small>ATASHA</small> [<i>sadly</i>] Somehow I don’t believe in words—and I’m restless
to-day—my heart is heavy .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. as if I were expecting something .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
it’s a pity, Vassily, that you talked to me to-day .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. When should I? It isn’t the first time I speak to you
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>N<small>ATASHA</small>. And why should I go with you? I don’t love you so very
much—sometimes I like you—and other times the mere sight of you makes me sick
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it seems—no—I don’t really love you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. when one really loves,
one sees no fault. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But I do see .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Never mind—you’ll love me after a while! I’ll make you care for
me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if you’ll just say yes! For over a year I’ve watched you
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you’re a decent girl .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you’re kind—you’re reliable—I’m very
much in love with you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Vassilisa, in her best dress, appears at window and
listens.</i>]</p>

<p>N<small>ATASHA</small>. Yes—you love me—but how about my sister .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small> [<i>confused</i>] Well, what of her? There are plenty like her
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. You’ll be all right, girl! If there’s no bread, you have to eat
weeds .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small> [<i>gloomily</i>] Please—feel a little sorry for me! My life isn’t
all roses—it’s a hell of a life .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. little happiness in it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
feel as if a swamp were sucking me under .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and whatever I try to catch and
hold on to, is rotten .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it breaks .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Your sister—oh—I <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-62">[Pg 62]</a></span>thought she was
different .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if she weren’t so greedy after money .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’d have
done anything for her sake, if she were only all mine .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but she must have
someone else .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and she has to have money—and freedom .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. because
she doesn’t like the straight and narrow .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she can’t help me. But you’re
like a young fir-tree .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you bend, but you don’t break .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Yes—go with him, girl, go! He’s a good lad—he’s all right! Only
tell him every now and then that he’s a good lad so that he won’t forget it—and he’ll
believe you. Just you keep on telling him “Vasya, you’re a good man—don’t you forget it!”
Just think, dear, where else could you go except with him? Your sister is a savage beast
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and as for her husband, there’s little to say of him? He’s rotten beyond
words .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and all this life here, where will it get you? But this lad is
strong .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>N<small>ATASHA</small>. Nowhere to go—I know—I thought of it. The only thing is—I’ve no
faith in anybody—and there’s no place for me to turn to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Yes, there is! But I won’t let you go that way—I’d rather cut
your throat!</p>

<p>N<small>ATASHA</small> [<i>smiling</i>] There—I’m not his wife yet—and he talks already
of killing me!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small> [<i>puts his arms around her</i>] Come, Natasha! Say yes!</p>

<p>N<small>ATASHA</small> [<i>holding him close</i>] But I’ll tell you one thing,
Vassily—I swear it before God .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the first time you strike me or hurt me any
other way, I’ll have no pity on myself .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’ll either hang myself
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. May my hand wither if ever I touch you!</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Don’t doubt him, dear! He needs you more than you need him!</p>

<p>V<small>ASSILISA</small> [<i>from the window</i>] So now they’re engaged! Love and
advice!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>N<small>ATASHA</small>. They’ve come back—oh, God—they saw—oh, Vassily
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Why are you frightened? Nobody’ll dare touch you now!</p>

<p>V<small>ASSILISA</small>. Don’t be afraid, Natalia! He won’t beat you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
he don’t know how to love or how to beat .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I know!</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small> [<i>in a low voice</i>] Rotten old hag—like a snake in the grass
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>V<small>ASSILISA</small>. He dares only with the word!</p>

<p>K<small>OSTILYOFF</small> [<i>enters</i>] Natashka! What are you doing here, you
parasite? Gossiping? Kicking about your family? And the samovar not ready? And the table
not cleared?</p>

<p>N<small>ATASHA</small> [<i>going out</i>] I thought you were going to church
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?</p>

<p>K<small>OSTILYOFF</small>. None of your business what we intended doing! Mind your own
affairs—and do what you’re told!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Shut up, you! She’s no longer your servant! Don’t go,
Natalia—don’t do a thing!</p>

<p>N<small>ATASHA</small>. Stop ordering me about—you’re commencing too soon!
[<i>Leaves</i>]</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small> [<i>to Kostilyoff</i>] That’s enough. You’ve used her long
enough—now she’s mine!</p>

<p>K<small>OSTILYOFF</small>. Yours? When did you buy her—and for how much?</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Vassilisa roars with laughter.</i>]</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Go away, Vasya!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Don’t laugh, you fools—or first thing you know I’ll make you
cry!</p>

<p>V<small>ASSILISA</small>. Oh, how terrible! Oh—how you frighten me!</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Vassily—go away! Don’t you see—she’s goading you on
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ridiculing you, don’t you understand .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small>. Yes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You lie, lie! You won’t get what you
want!</p>

<p>V<small>ASSILISA</small>. Nor will I get what I don’t want, Vasya!</p>

<p>P<small>EPEL</small> [<i>shaking his fist at her</i>] We’ll see .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
[<i>Exit</i>]</p>

<p>V<small>ASSILISA</small> [<i>disappearing through window</i>] I’ll arrange some wedding
for you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>K<small>OSTILYOFF</small> [<i>crossing to Luka</i>] Well, old man, how’s
everything?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. All right!</p>

<p>K<small>OSTILYOFF</small>. You’re going away, they say—?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Soon.</p>

<p>K<small>OSTILYOFF</small>. Where to?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. I’ll follow my nose .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>K<small>OSTILYOFF</small>. Tramping, eh? Don’t like stopping in one place all the time,
do you?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Even water won’t pass beneath a stone that’s sunk too firmly in
the ground, they say .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>K<small>OSTILYOFF</small>. That’s true for a stone. But man must settle in one place.
Men can’t live like cockroaches, crawling about wherever they want. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A man
must stick to one place—and not wander about aimlessly .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. But suppose his home is wherever he hangs his hat?</p>

<p>K<small>OSTILYOFF</small>. Why, then—he’s a vagabond,—useless .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a human
being must be of some sort of use—he must work .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. That’s what you think, eh?</p>

<p>K<small>OSTILYOFF</small>. Yes—sure .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. just look! What’s a vagabond? A
strange fellow .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. unlike all others. If he’s a real pilgrim then he’s some
good in the world .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. perhaps he discovered a new truth. Well—but not every
truth is worth while. Let him keep it to himself and shut up about it! Or else—let him
speak in a way which no one can understand .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. don’t let him interfere
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. don’t let him stir up people without cause! It’s none of his business how
other people live! Let him follow his own righteous path .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in the woods—or
<span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-65">[Pg 65]</a></span>in a
monastery—away from everybody! He mustn’t interfere—nor condemn other people—but pray—pray
for all of us—for all the world’s sins—for mine—for yours—for everybody’s. To pray—that’s
why he forsakes the world’s turmoil! That’s so! [<i>Pause</i>] But you—what sort of a
pilgrim are you—? An honest person must have a passport .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all honest people
have passports .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. !</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. In this world there are people—and also just plain men
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>K<small>OSTILYOFF</small>. Don’t coin wise sayings! Don’t give me riddles! I’m as
clever as you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what’s the difference—people and men?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. What riddle is there? I say—there’s sterile and there’s fertile
ground .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. whatever you sow in it, grows .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that’s all
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>K<small>OSTILYOFF</small>. What do you mean?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Take yourself for instance .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. if the Lord God himself
said to you: “Mikhailo, be a man!”—it would be useless—nothing would come of it—you’re
doomed to remain just as you are .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>K<small>OSTILYOFF</small>. Oh—but do you realize that my wife’s uncle is a policeman,
and that if I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>V<small>ASSILISA</small> [<i>coming in</i>] Mikhail Ivanitch—come and have your tea
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>K<small>OSTILYOFF</small> [<i>to Luka</i>] You listen! Get out! You leave this
place—hear?</p>

<p>V<small>ASSILISA</small>. Yes—get out, old man! Your tongue’s too long! And—who
knows—you may be an escaped convict .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>K<small>OSTILYOFF</small>. If I ever see sign of you again after to-day—well—I’ve
warned you!</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. You’ll call your uncle, eh? Go on—call him! Tell him you’ve caught
an escaped convict—and maybe uncle’ll get a reward—perhaps all of three kopecks
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small> [<i>in the window</i>] What are you bargaining about? Three
kopecks—for what?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. They’re threatening to sell me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>V<small>ASSILISA</small> [<i>to her husband</i>] Come .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. For three kopecks? Well—look out, old man—they may even do it
for one!</p>

<p>K<small>OSTILYOFF</small> [<i>to Bubnoff</i>] You have a habit of jumping up like a
jack-in-the-box!</p>

<p>V<small>ASSILISA</small>. The world is full of shady people and crooks—</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Hope you’ll enjoy your tea!</p>

<p>V<small>ASSILISA</small> [<i>turning</i>] Shut up! You rotten toadstool!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Leaves with her husband.</i>]</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. I’m off to-night.</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. That’s right. Don’t outstay your welcome!</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. True enough.</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. I know. Perhaps I’ve escaped the gallows by getting away in
time .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Well?</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. That’s true. It was this way. My wife took up with my boss. He
was great at his trade—could dye a dog’s skin so that it looked like a raccoon’s—could
change cat’s skin into kangaroo—muskrats, all sorts of things. Well—my wife took up with
him—and they were so mad about each other that I got afraid they might poison me or
something like that—so I commenced beating up my wife—and the boss beat me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
we fought savagely! Once he tore off half my whiskers—and broke one of my ribs
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, then I, too, got enraged. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I cracked my wife over the
head with an iron yard-measure—well—and altogether it was like an honest-to-God war! And
then I saw that nothing really could come of it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they were planning to get
the best of me! So I started planning—how to kill my wife—I thought of it a whole lot
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but I thought better of it just in time .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and got away
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. That was best! Let them go on changing dogs into raccoons!</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. Only—the shop was in my wife’s name .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and so I
did myself out of it, you see? Although, to tell the truth, I would have drunk it away
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’m a hard drinker, you know .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. A hard drinker—oh .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. The worst you ever met! Once I start drinking, I drink
everything in sight, I’ll spend every bit of money I have—everything except my bones and
my skin .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. what’s more, I’m lazy .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it’s terrible how I hate
work!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Enter Satine and the Actor, quarreling.</i>]</p>

<p>S<small>ATINE</small>. Nonsense! You’ll go nowhere—it’s all a damned lie! Old man, what
did you stuff him with all those fairy-tales for?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> A<small>CTOR</small>. You lie! Grandfather! Tell him that he lies!—I
am going away. I worked to-day—I swept the streets .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and I didn’t have a
drop of vodka. What do you think of that? Here they are—two fifteen kopeck pieces—and I’m

<p>S<small>ATINE</small>. Why—that’s absurd! Give it to me—I’ll either drink it up—or lose
it at cards .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> A<small>CTOR</small>. Get out—this is for my journey

<p>L<small>UKA</small> [<i>to Satine</i>] And you—why are you trying to lead him

<p>S<small>ATINE</small>. Tell me, soothsayer, beloved by the Gods, what’s my future going

.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. there are sharks in this world who got more brains than I!</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. You’re cheerful, Constantine—and very agreeable!</p>

<p>B<small>UBNOFF</small>. Actor, come over here! [<i>The Actor crosses to window, sits
down on the sill before Bubnoff, and speaks in a low voice with him</i>]</p>

<p>S<small>ATINE</small>. You know, brother, I used to be a clever <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-68">[Pg 68]</a></span>youngster. It’s nice to
think of it. I was a devil of a fellow .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. danced splendidly, played on the
stage, loved to amuse people .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it was awfully gay .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. How did you get to be what you are?</p>

<p>S<small>ATINE</small>. You’re inquisitive, old man! You want to know everything? What
for?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. I want to understand the ways of men—I look at you, and I don’t
understand. You’re a bold lad, Constantine, and you’re no fool .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. yet, all of
a sudden .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>S<small>ATINE</small>. It’s prison, grandfather—I spent four years and seven months in
prison .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. afterwards—where could I go?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Aha! What were you there for?</p>

<p>S<small>ATINE</small>. On account of a scoundrel—whom I killed in a fit of rage
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and despair .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and in prison I learned to play cards
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. You killed—because of a woman?</p>

<p>S<small>ATINE</small>. Because of my own sister. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But look here—leave me
alone! I don’t care for these cross-examinations—and all this happened a long time ago.
It’s already nine years since my sister’s death. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Brother, she was a
wonderful girl .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. You take life easily! And only a while ago that locksmith was
here—and how he did yell!</p>

<p>S<small>ATINE</small>. Kleshtch?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small>. Yes—“There’s no work,” he shouted; “there isn’t anything
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>S<small>ATINE</small>. He’ll get used to it. What could I do?</p>

<p>L<small>UKA</small> [<i>softly</i>] Look—here he comes!</p>

<p class="direction">[<i>Kleshtch walks in slowly, his head bowed low.</i>]</p>

<p>S<small>ATINE</small>. Hey, widower! Why are you so down in the mouth? What are you
thinking?</p>

<p>K<small>LESHTCH</small>. I’m thinking—what’ll I do? I’ve no food—nothing—the funeral
ate up all .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>S<small>ATINE</small>. I’ll give you a bit of advice .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. do nothing! Just
be a burden to the world at large!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p>K<small>LESHTCH</small>. Go on—talk—I’d be ashamed of myself .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>S<small>ATINE</small>. Why—people aren’t ashamed to let you live worse than a dog. Just
think .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you stop work—so do I—so do hundreds, thousands of
others—everybody—understand?—everybody’ll quit working .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. nobody’ll do a
damned thing—and then what’ll happen?</p>

<p>K<small>LESHTCH</small>. They’ll all starve to death .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<div class="setting">
<p class="italics">Same as Act I. But Pepel’s room is no longer there, and the partition
has been removed. Furthermore, there is no anvil at the place where Kleshtch used to sit
and work. In the corner, where Pepel’s room used to be, the Tartar lies stretched out,
rather restless, and groaning from time to time. Kleshtch sits at one end of the table,
repairing a concertina and now and then testing the stops. At the other end of the table
sit Satine, the Baron, and Nastya. In front of them stand a bottle of vodka, three bottles
of beer, and a large loaf of black bread. The Actor lies on top of the stove, shifting
about and coughing. It is night. The stage is lit by a lamp in the middle of the table.
Outside the wind howls.</p>

<p>K<small>LESHTCH</small>. Yes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he disappeared during the confusion and
noise .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. He vanished under the very eyes of the

<p>S<small>ATINE</small>. That’s how sinners flee from the company of the righteous!</p>

<p>N<small>ASTYA</small>. He was a dear old soul! But you—you aren’t men—you’re
just—oh—like rust on iron!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small> [<i>drinks</i>] Here’s to you, my lady!</p>

<p>S<small>ATINE</small>. He was an inquisitive old fellow—yes! Nastenka here fell in love
with him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>N<small>ASTYA</small>. Yes! I did! Madly! It’s true! He saw everything—understood
everything .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>S<small>ATINE</small> [<i>laughing</i>] Yes, generally speaking, I would say that he
was—oh—like mush to those who can’t chew. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small> [<i>laughing</i>] Right! Like plaster on a
boil!</p>

<p>K<small>LESHTCH</small>. He was merciful—you people don’t know what pity means
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>S<small>ATINE</small>. What good can I do you by pitying you?</p>

<p>K<small>LESHTCH</small>. You needn’t have pity—but you needn’t harm or offend your
fellow-beings, either!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> T<small>ARTAR</small> [<i>sits up on his bunk, nursing his wounded
hand carefully</i>] He was a fine old man. The law of life was the law of his heart
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and he who obeys this law, is good, while he who disregards it, perishes
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. What law, Prince?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> T<small>ARTAR</small>. There are a number—different ones—you know
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. Proceed!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> T<small>ARTAR</small>. Do not do harm unto others—such is the
law!</p>

<p>S<small>ATINE</small>. Oh—you mean the Penal Code, criminal and correctional, eh?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. And also the Code of Penalties inflicted by
Justices of the Peace!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> T<small>ARTAR</small>. No. I mean the Koran. It is the supreme
law—and your own soul ought to be the Koran—yes!</p>

<p>K<small>LESHTCH</small> [<i>testing his concertina</i>] It wheezes like all hell! But
the Prince speaks the truth—one must live abiding by the law—by the teachings of the
Gospels .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>S<small>ATINE</small>. Well—go ahead and do it!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. Just try it!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> T<small>ARTAR</small>. The Prophet Mohammed gave to us the law. He
said: “Here is the law! Do as it is written therein!” Later on a time will arrive when the
Koran will have outlived its purpose—and time will bring forth its own laws—every
generation will create its own .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>S<small>ATINE</small>. To be sure! Time passed on—and gave <span class="pagenum"><a

strong law, brother—it won’t wear off so very soon!</p>

<p>N<small>ASTYA</small> [<i>banging her glass on the table</i>] Why—why do I stay
here—with you? I’ll go away somewhere—to the ends of the world!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. Without any shoes, my lady?</p>

<p>N<small>ASTYA</small>. I’ll go—naked, if must be—creeping on all fours!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. That’ll be rather picturesque, my lady—on all
fours!</p>

<p>N<small>ASTYA</small>. Yes—and I’ll crawl if I have to—anything at all—as long as I
don’t have to see your faces any longer—oh, I’m so sick of it all—the life—the
people—everything!</p>

<p>S<small>ATINE</small>. When you go, please take the actor along—he’s preparing to go to
the very same place—he has learned that within a half mile’s distance of the end of the
world there’s a hospital for diseased organons .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> A<small>CTOR</small> [<i>raising his head over the top of the

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. Who is he, sir?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> A<small>CTOR</small>. I!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. Thanks, servant of the goddess—what’s her
name—? The goddess of drama—tragedy—whatever is her name—?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> A<small>CTOR</small>. The muse, idiot! Not the goddess—the muse!</p>

<p>S<small>ATINE</small>. Lachesis—Hera—Aphrodite—Atropos—oh! To hell with them all! You
see—Baron—it was the old man who stuffed the actor’s head full with this rot
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. That old man’s a fool .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> A<small>CTOR</small>. Ignoramuses! Beasts! Melpomene—that’s her
name! Heartless brutes! Bastards! You’ll <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage"
id="page-77">[Pg 77]</a></span>see! He’ll go! “On with the orgy, dismal
spirits!”—poem—ah—by Béranger! Yes—he’ll find some spot where there’s no—no
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. Where there’s nothing, sir?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> A<small>CTOR</small>. Right! Nothing! “This hole shall be my grave—I
am dying—ill and exhausted .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Why do you exist? Why?</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. You! God or genius or orgy—or whatever you

<p>T<small>HE</small> A<small>CTOR</small>. You lie! I’ll roar all I want to!</p>

<p>N<small>ASTYA</small> [<i>lifting her head from the table and throwing up her
hands</i>] Go on! Yell! Let them listen to you!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. Where is the sense, my lady?</p>

<p>S<small>ATINE</small>. Leave them alone, Baron! To hell with the lot! Let them yell—let
them knock their damned heads off if they feel like it! There’s a method in their madness!
Don’t you go and interfere with people as that old fellow did! Yes—it’s he—the damned old
fool—he bewitched the whole gang of us!</p>

<p>K<small>LESHTCH</small>. He persuaded them to go away—but failed to show them the road
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. That old man was a humbug!</p>

<p>N<small>ASTYA</small>. Liar! You’re a humbug yourself!</p>

<p>T<small>HE</small> B<small>ARON</small>. Shut up, my lady!</p>

<p>K<small>LESHTCH</small>. The old man didn’t like truth very much—as a matter of fact he
strongly resented it—and wasn’t he right, though? Just look—where is there any truth? And
yet, without it, you can’t breathe! For instance, our Tartar Prince over there, crushed
his hand at his work—and now he’ll have to have his arm amputated—and there’s the truth
for you!</p>

<p>S<small>ATINE</small> [<i>striking the table with his clenched fist</i>] Shut up! You
sons of bitches! Fools! Not another word about that old fellow! [<i>To the Baron</i>] You,
Baron, are the worst of the lot! You don’t understand a thing, and you lie like the devil!
The old man’s no humbug! What’s the truth? Man! Man—that’s the truth! He <span
class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-78">[Pg 78]</a></span>understood man—you
don’t! You’re all as dumb as stones! I understand the old man—yes! He lied—but lied out of
sheer pity for you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. God damn you! Lots of people lie out of pity for their
fellow-beings! I know! I’ve read about it! They lie—oh—beautifully, inspiringly,
stirringly! Some lies bring comfort, and others bring peace—a lie alone can justify the
burden which crushed a workman’s hand and condemns those who are starving! I know what
lying means! The weakling and the one who is a parasite through his very weakness—they
both need lies—lies are their support, their shield, their armor! But the man who is
strong, who is his own master, who is free and does not have to suck his neighbors’

people at times speak like crooks? Yes—I’ve forgotten a lot—but I still know a thing or

Let’s drink to his health! Fill the glasses .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [<i>Nastya fills a glass with
beer and hands it to Satine, who laughs</i>] The old man lives within himself
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he looks upon all the world from his own angle. Once I asked him:
“Grand-dad, why do people live?” [<i>Tries to imitate Luka’s voice and gestures</i>] And
he replied: “Why, my dear fellow, people live in the hope of something better! For
example—let’s say there are carpenters in this world, and all sorts of trash
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. people .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and they give birth to a carpenter the like of
which has never been seen upon the face of the earth .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. he’s way above
everybody else, and has no equal among carpenters! The brilliancy of his personality was
reflected on all his trade, on all the other carpenters, so that they advanced twenty
years <span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-79">[Pg 79]</a></span>in one day!
This applies to all other trades—blacksmiths and shoemakers and other workmen—and all the
peasants—and even the aristocrats live in the hopes of a higher life! Each individual
thinks that he’s living for his own Self, but in reality he lives in the hope of something
better. A hundred years—sometimes longer—do we expect, live for the finer, higher life
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” [<i>Nastya stares intently into Satine’s face. Kleshtch stops working and
listens. The Baron bows his head very low, drumming softly on the table with his fingers.

“Every one, brothers, every one lives in the hope of something better. That’s why we must
respect each and every human being! How do we know who he is, why he was born, and what he
is capable of accomplishing? Perhaps his coming into the world will prove to be our good
fortune .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Especially must we respect little children! Children—need freedom!
Don’t interfere with their lives! Respect children!” [<i>Pause</i>]</p>

<p>K<small>VASHNYA</small> [<i>laughs</i>] You fool! You aren’t blind, are you? Why wash
dirty linen in public? And—it hurts his feelings—that’s why he took to drink

<p>In general, this transcription attempts to retain the formatting, punctuation and
spelling of the source text. The following changes were noted:</p>

<ul>
<li>p. 8: I’m sick myself—poisoned with alchohol .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.—Changed “alchohol” to
“alcohol”.</li>

<li>The portrait of Gorky originally between pages 26 and 27 was moved so that it appears
after page 28, between Acts One and Two.</li>

<li>p. 50: S<small>ATINE</small> [<i>screams</i>] The dead can’t hear .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the
dead do not feel—Scream!—Roar! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the deaf don’t hear!—A hand-written note in
the source images changed the word “deaf” to “dead”. To verify the change, translations by

“the dead don’t hear!”</li>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
